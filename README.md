# binarytree
1. binaray tree traversals
2. count of leaf
3. Height of Tree
4. Diameter of Tree (The diameter of a tree (sometimes called the width) is the number of nodes on the longest path between two end nodes.)
5. Balanced Tree or Not
6. Tree Identical or Not
7. Sum Tree or Not (Given a Binary Tree. Return true if, for every node X in the tree other than the leaves, its value is equal to the sum of its left subtree's value    and its right subtree's value. Else return false.)
8.  ZigZag Traversal
9. Boundary Traversal
10. Vertical Order 
11. Top View
12. Bottom View
13. Right View
14. Left View
15. Sum of nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node 
16. Longest common ancestor of Binary Tree
17. K Sum paths(Find the number of paths in the tree which have their sum equal to K.)
18. Kth Ancestor
